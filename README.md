# 🚀 KYC/AML Dashboard

This project performs **KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) analysis** using **Python** and **Plotly**.  
It generates a **detailed CSV report** and an **interactive dashboard** to help identify suspicious customers and analyze risk levels.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The dashboard provides:

- **Risk Level Distribution** (High / Medium / Low) 📈  
- **Top 10 Customers by Transaction Amount** 💰  
- **Number of Transactions per Customer** (Histogram) 📊  
- **Suspicious vs Non-Suspicious Customers** (Pie chart) 🛑✅  

The Python script **merges KYC and transaction data**, flags suspicious customers, calculates risk levels, and outputs both a detailed CSV report and an interactive HTML dashboard.
